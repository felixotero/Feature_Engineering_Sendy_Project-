# Feature_Engineering_Sendy_Project

Description
The objective is to create a model to help predict the estimated time of delivery of orders, from the point of driver pickup to the point of arrival at the final destination. 
An accurate arrival time prediction will help all business to improve their logistics and communicate the accurate time their time to their customers. You will be required to perform various feature engineering techniques while preparing your data for further analysis.

The Project involves the below steps

Create the base model (ensemble regressor), then improving the accuracy of the base model by performing the following feature engineering techniques:

● Feature improvement

○ Handle categorical features

○ Find and deal with missing values

○ Handle any outliers in your dataset

● Feature scaling (normalisation or standardisation etc.)

● Feature construction

○ Creating new features i.e. speed = distance/time, manhattan distance from pick up latitude and Longitude i.e. manhattan distance, haversine distance, bearing, centre point etc.

● Feature Selection

○ Filter methods

○ Feature transformation (PCA, LDA, etc)

○ Wrapper methods
